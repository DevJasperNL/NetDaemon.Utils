## Example Usage

```cs
public Example(
    SunEntities sunEntities, 
    CoverEntities coverEntities)
{
    const int curtainCloseSunElevation = 1;
    sunEntities.Sun
            .ToBooleanObservable(e => e.Attributes?.Elevation <= curtainCloseSunElevation);
    
    sunIsDown.SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () =>
        {
            coverEntities.LivingRoomFrontWindowCurtain.CloseCover();
            coverEntities.LivingRoomBackWindowCurtain.CloseCover();
        },
        () =>
        {
            coverEntities.LivingRoomFrontWindowCurtain.OpenCover();
            coverEntities.LivingRoomBackWindowCurtain.OpenCover();
        });
}
```

**Breakdown:**

```cs
sunEntities.Sun.ToBooleanObservable(e => e.Attributes?.Elevation <= curtainCloseSunElevation);
```
Create a stateful `IObservable<bool>` from the sun entity `Sun` which emits `true` when `Elevation` is smaller than `curtainCloseSunElevation`, `false` otherwise. Stateful in this context means that the observable will immediately emit the current value returned from the predicate when an observer is subscribed. (internally, the NetDaemon extension methods `StateChangesWithCurrent` and `StateAllChangesWithCurrent` are used for this.)

```cs
sunIsDown.SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () =>
        {
            coverEntities.LivingRoomFrontWindowCurtain.CloseCover();
            coverEntities.LivingRoomBackWindowCurtain.CloseCover();
        },
        () =>
        {
            coverEntities.LivingRoomFrontWindowCurtain.OpenCover();
            coverEntities.LivingRoomBackWindowCurtain.OpenCover();
        });
```

`SubscribeTrueFalse` is an extension method on `IObservable<bool>` that assigns an action for when `true` is emitted as well as when `false` is emitted.

This implementation will immediately open or close the covers depending on the initial result of the predicate as well as update whenever the result of the predicate changes.

## Boolean Observables

This library contains a set of extension methods to convert entities to implementations of `IObservable<bool>`. If no predicate is provided, the `On` state is mapped to true, the `Off` state is mapped to `false`.

The usage of `ToBooleanObservable` (or one of the aliases `ToOnOffObservable` or `ToOpenClosedObservable`) on an entity will use `StateChanges` (or `StateAllChanges` when a predicate is provided) to result in a stateful `IObservable<bool>`.

In case a stateful observable is not desired, the method `ToChangesOnlyBooleanObservable` can be used.

The use of stateful `IObservable<bool>` implementations enables the use of logic operators and scheduling extensions provided by the `Reactive.Boolean` library. This allows for improved readability of implementations.

For a more detailed documentation on extension methods for `IObservable<bool>`, check out the documentation for `Reactive.Boolean` [here](https://github.com/DevJasperNL/Reactive.Boolean).

**Example**

The following example shows the usage of boolean (`Not`, `Or` and `And`) and scheduling (`LimitTrueDuration`) logic to write a complex automation that is still easy to understand and will trigger on startup.
```cs
var noOneAsleep = inputBooleanEntities.JasperAsleep.ToBooleanObservable()
    .Or(inputBooleanEntities.AnonAsleep.ToBooleanObservable()).Not();

var closetDoorOpenShorterThanOneMin = binarySensorEntities.BedroomClosetDoorSensorContact
    .ToOpenClosedObservable().LimitTrueDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), scheduler);

noOneAsleep.And(closetDoorOpenShorterThanOneMin).SubscribeTrueFalse(
    () => lightEntities.ClosetLight.TurnOn(),
    () => lightEntities.ClosetLight.TurnOff());
```

Note that even though scheduling is mostly handled by the `Reactive.Boolean` library, knowledge of the `Entity` does improve some scheduling methods. In the cases of `WhenTrueFor` and `LimitTrueDuration` both `LastChanged` and the passing of time are used to evaluate whether a true is emitted.

## Scheduling

A breakdown of all scheduling extension methods this library enables for `Entity` and `IObservable<bool>`:

### OnForAtLeast

Returns an observable that won't emit `false` for at least the provided timespan after an initial `on` (`true`) is emitted by the `entity`.
If a `false` is emitted during the provided timespan, it will be emitted immediately after the timer is completed.

**Example Use Case**

Turn on a light for at least 3 seconds after a button was pressed. If 3 seconds are passed, only keep it on if the button is still being pressed, but immediately turn if off if not.
```cs
// buttonPressed is a IObservable<bool>
var buttonPressed = buttonEntity.ToBooleanObservable(s => s.State == "pressed");
buttonPressed
    .TrueForAtLeast(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3), scheduler)
    .SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () => lightEntity.TurnOn(),
        () => lightEntity.TurnOff());
```

> Aliases: `OpenForAtLeast`/`TrueForAtLeast`.

### PersistOnFor

Returns an observable that delays the first `off` (`false`) that is emitted after an `on` (`true`) by the `entity` for a duration of the provided timespan.

**Example Use Case**

Keep a light on for 3 more seconds after last motion was detected.
```cs
// motionDetected is a IObservable<bool>
var motionDetected = motionSensorEntity.ToBooleanObservable(s => s.State == "motion");
motionDetected
    .PersistTrueFor(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3), scheduler)
    .SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () => lightEntity.TurnOn(),
        () => lightEntity.TurnOff());
```

> Aliases: `PersistOpenFor`/`PersistTrueFor`.

### WhenOnFor

Returns an observable that emits `true` once `entity` does not emit `off` (`false`) for a minimum of the provided timespan.

When called on an `Entity`, this method takes into account `EntityState.LastChanged`, meaning the returned observable can emit `true` even if the time did not pass during runtime.

**Example Use Case**

Send notification when washing machine power has been 0 for at least 1 minute.
```cs
// washingMachineCurrentIsZero is a IObservable<bool>
var washingMachineCurrentIsZero = washingMachineCurrentEntity.ToBooleanObservable(s => s.State == 0);
washingMachineCurrentIsZero
    .WhenTrueFor(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1), scheduler)
    .SubscribeTrue(() => notificationEntity.Send("Washing machine is done!"));
```

> Aliases: `WhenOpenFor`/`WhenTrueFor`.

### LimitOnDuration

Returns an observable that will automatically emit `false` if the `entity` does not emit an `off` (`false`) itself within the provided timespan after emitting `on` (`true`).

When called on an `Entity`, this method takes into account `EntityState.LastChanged`, meaning the returned observable can emit `false` even if the time did not pass during runtime.

**Example Use Case**

Keep closet lights on for a maximum amount of time.
```cs
// closetDoorOpen is a IObservable<bool>
var closetDoorOpen = closetDoorEntity.ToBooleanObservable(s => s.State == "open");
closetDoorOpen
    .LimitTrueDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2), scheduler)
    .SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () => closetLightEntity.TurnOn(),
        () => closetLightEntity.TurnOff());
```

> Aliases: `LimitOpenDuration`/`LimitCloseDuration`.

## Unavailability of entities

This library also implements the utility method `RepeatWhenEntitiesBecomeAvailable<T>`. This method can be called on a `IObservable<T>` to repeat a value when one of the provided entities become available.

**Example**

The following example will re-apply the correct state as soon as the plug becomes available (is plugged in).
```cs
const int nightTimeSunElevation = 0;
var nightTime = sunEntities.Sun
    .ToBooleanObservable(e => e.Attributes?.Elevation <= nightTimeSunElevation);

nightTime
    .RepeatWhenEntitiesBecomeAvailable(switchEntities.LivingRoomChristmasTreeLights)
    .SubscribeTrueFalse(
        () => switchEntities.LivingRoomChristmasTreeLights.TurnOn(),
        () => switchEntities.LivingRoomChristmasTreeLights.TurnOff());
```
